================

AngularJS directive for implementing pan and zoom on any DOM element

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mvindahl/angular-pan-zoom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mvindahl/angular-pan-zoom)

NOTE: Migration from 0.9.0 to 1.0.0
-----------------------------------
The 1.0.0 release introduced a breaking change in how the panzoom widget publishes its API. Migration guide [here](https://github.com/mvindahl/angular-pan-zoom/wiki/Migrating-from-0.9.0-to-1.0.0)

Getting it:
-----------
Get the code from github. Or simpler yet, use bower:
```
bower install angular-pan-zoom
```
Or NPM:
```
npm install angular-pan-zoom --save
```

Features:
---------
- Zoom using mouse wheel, double click, or control widget
- Pan using click and drag. When releasing mouse button while panning, the pan will come to a gradual stop.
- AngularJS integrated. Models are used as APIs for communicating
- Widget with zoom controls provided. Use this or design your own controls if you so prefer.

Requirements:
-------------
- AngularJS (obviously)
- jQuery (used for managing timing loops)
- Hamster.JS (for mouse wheel support)
- angular-mousewheel (which integrates HamsterJS with angular)

For convenience, these requirements are checked in as part of the project. They are also described by the bower.json file.

Demo:
-----
Click [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://rawgithub.com/mvindahl/angular-pan-zoom/master/demo/demo.dev.html) for an online demo of
the functionality.

Usage:
------
### Simplest working example

When declaring your module:
```
angular.module('your_module', ['panzoom', ..])
```

In your controller:
```
$scope.config = {}; // use defaults
$scope.model = {}; // always pass empty object
```

In your markup:
```
<body>
  ..
  <!-- create panzoom, passing models from controller -->
  <panzoom config="config" model="model" style="width:800px; height: 600px">
    <!-- your content here -->
  </panzoom>
  ..
  <!-- include scripts -->
  <script src="bower_components/jQuery/dist/jQuery.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/hamsterjs/hamster.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/angular-mousewheel/mousewheel.js"></script>
  <script src="release/panzoom.js"></script>
</body>
```

This will provide zoom and pan functionality using default settings. It will, however, not provide any widget to control the zoom and pan.

### Using the provided zoom pan widget

To use the bundled `<panzoomwidget>`, you need to
- include release/panzoomwidget.css on your page
- make your AngularJS module depend upon the panzoomwidget module
- declare an `id` attribute on your `<panzoom>` tag
- use a `<panzoomwidget>` directive in the markup, specifying its `panzoom-id` attribute to be the same value as the `id` of the `<panzoom>` tag
You will probably also want to position the widget above the zoomed contents be means of CSS. Check ./test.html for a working example.

### Implementing your own external controls

Refer to panzoomwidget.js for an example of how this may be done. Whether or not you create it as a directive is up to you. To access
the API of a panzoom directive, you need to look it up using the `getAPI()` method on the bundled `PanZoomService`, passing the id of the
`<panzoom>` widget. The method will return a promise.

Example usage:
```
// assuming the PanZoomService to be a dependency and panzoomId to be the ID of the <panzoom> directive ...
PanZoomService.getAPI(panzoomId).then(function (api) {
    // you can now invoke the api
}
```

The API
-------
The API object contains the following properties:

Method                           | Description
-------------------------------- | -----------
`model`                          | the model object which was passed to the panzoom directive
`config`                         | the config object which was passed to the panzoom directive
`changeZoomLevel(newZoomLevel [,clickPoint])`              | change zoom level to a new value using a quick animation
`zoomIn()`                       | shorthand for increasing zoom level by one
`zoomOut()`                      | shorthand for decreasing zoom level by one
`zoomToFit(rectangle)`           | zoom to display a part of the contents. Example rectangle: { "x": 0, "y": 100, "width": 100, "height": 100 }
`getViewPosition(modelPosition)` | takes a argument a {x:.., y:..} in the original, untransformed contents. Returns the current pixel position of this point.
`getModelPosition(viewPosition)` | the reverse operation of getViewPosition()


The config object:
------------------
May be used to pass configuration options to the panzoom directive. The directive will fill
in any "blanks" with default values.

The config object is not intended to be modified once initialized.

The following config object attributes are supported:

Name                                | Type      | Default           | Description
----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------- | -----------
zoomLevels                          | number    | 5                 | Number of discrete zoom levels, each one representing a scale.
neutralZoomLevel                    | number    | 2                 | The zoom level at which the centents render at 1:1 scale
scalePerZoomLevel                   | number    | 2.0               | The difference in actual scale between two adjacent zoom levels.
initialZoomLevel                    | number    | neutralZoomLevel  | The initially selected zoom level
initialPanX                         | number    | 0                 | The initial pan in the horizontal direction
initialPanY                         | number    | 0                 | The initial pan in the vertical direction
zoomToFitZoomLevelFactor            | number    | 0.95              | A number to indicate how closely zoom to fit will work. 1.0 is perfect fit, lowering the number will reveal a bit of the surrounding contents 
zoomOnDoubleClick                   | boolean   | true              | Enable or disable zoom in on double click
zoomButtonIncrement                 | number    | 1.0               | The amount of zoom levels to zoom on double click
zoomStepDuration                    | number    | 0.2               | Amount of seconds to animate between two adjacent zoom levels
disableZoomAnimation                | boolean   | false             | Set to true to disable the animation while zooming. It will be more chunky but will consule less CPU resources.
zoomOnMouseWheel                    | boolean   | true              | Enable or disable zoom in/out on mouse wheel
invertMouseWheel                    | boolean   | false             | Invert the behaviour of the mouse wheel (or two finger trackpad gesture)
friction                            | number    | 10.0              | Constant which controls the friction when dragging and then letting go. The higher the number, the more quickly the animation will come to a stop.
haltSpeed                           | number    | 100.0             | Constant which controls when the pan animation has slowed down enough to be terminated. The lower the number, the longer time it will run.
panOnClickDrag                      | boolean   | true              | Enable or disable pan on clicking and dragging the mouse
modelChangedCallback                | function  | undefined         | Pass a function to receive events when the model changes. The model will be passed to the function.
useHardwareAcceleration             | boolean   | false             | Use translate3d for panning instead of using standard CSS styles 'left' and 'top'. This is intended to trigger hardware acceleration and may increase the speed greatly. In future versions, this may be set to true as default.
chromeUseTransform                  | boolean   | false             | Cause Chrome to use CSS transform instead of CSS zoom. Enable if you use nested SVG and see performance problems in Chrome.
initialZoomToFit                    | rectangle | undefined         | When defined, will initially zoom to fit the given rectangle (see API for explanation of zoom to fit). This overrides the initialZoomLevel, initialPanX, and initialPanY values.
keepInBounds                        | boolean   | false             | When true, it will not be possible to pan the contents off the screen -- it will snap back when trying to do so -- and it will not be possible to zoom further out than the neutral zoom level.
keepInBoundsRestoreForce            | number    | 0.5               | Constant to control how quickly the contents snap back in place after attempting to pan off bounds.
keepInBoundsDragPullback            | number    | 0.7               | Constant to control the perceived force preventing dragging the contents off limits.


The model object:
-----------------
When initializing, you should pass an empty object. The directive will initialize the object.
You can read the current zoom and pan state at any time from this object.
